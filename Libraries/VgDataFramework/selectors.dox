\page vdfSelectors Data Selectors

\brief Use of selectors to control what data is made available to consumers.

The VisGUI data framework uses \em selectors to request data from data nodes.
In the absence of selectors, a data node will provide all possible data to a
consumer, or in some cases, no data at all. As this is usually not desired,
selectors are used to choose the most appropriate data, and to limit data
according to user preferences or for performance reasons.

Selectors are implemented via the abstract object class vdfSelector, and use
meta-casting and the vdfSelectorType static meta-object identifier to determine
their function. This allows the set of possible selectors to be variable, such
that libraries may define new selectors that are not known to the core library.

The function of selectors is described by their respective class documentation.
See vdfSelector's subclasses for a list of selectors defined in the core
library.
